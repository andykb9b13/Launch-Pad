## Description

Starting a small business can be incredibly daunting and the pressure of finding funding can feel daunting. LaunchPad is a funding website for small businesses to post items they are in need and donors can contribute to. Each business can create it's own profile and track the progress of funding for each item. When an item is funded, the business receives that amount. Donors can also choose to buy the item directly from a site linked by the business.
